        question: "What is an NFT?",
        answer: "NFT stands for a non-fungible token, which means it can neither be replaced nor interchanged because it has unique properties. An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.

        question: "How Do NFTs Work?",
        answer: "An NFT can only have one owner at a time. Ownership is managed through the uniqueID and metadata that no other token can replicate. NFTs are minted through smart contracts that assign ownership and manage the transferability of the NFT's. When someone creates or mints an NFT, they execute code stored in smart contracts that conform to different standards, such as ERC-721. This information is added to the blockchain where the NFT is being managed."

        question: "How Is an NFT Different from Cryptocurrency?",
        answer: "NFT stands for non-fungible token. It’s generally built using the same kind of programming as cryptocurrency. Physical money and cryptocurrencies are fungible, meaning they can be traded or exchanged for one another. NFTs are different. Each has a digital signature that makes it impossible for NFTs to be exchanged for or equal to one another."

        question: "How Does Ethereum Work?",
        answer: "Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, is blockchain technology. Imagine a very long chain of blocks—all of the information contained in each block is added to every newly-created block along with the new data. Throughout the network is a distributed and identical copy of the blockchain. This blockchain is validated by a network of automated programs that reach a consensus on the validity of transaction information. No changes can be made to the blockchain unless the network reaches a consensus, which makes it very secure."
