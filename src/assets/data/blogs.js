        descriptionLong: "NFT = Non Fungible Token, just kidding. Think of an NFT as birth certificate, unique and one of a kind, it's proof that it's you. It cannot be replaced with anything else.

But, on the flip side, solutions must be critically examined, and from the investor’s perspective, the prospect is what matters, and this piece briefly looks at the potential outlook for the metaverse in 2022.",
